William Fulton
Rasterization Project

Description: 
	- This project was submitted as a final presentation for my Computer Graphics class.     
	- I used rasterization to project vertices of the triangle using perspective projection.
	- I aligned vertices of the triangles to create a cube and a plumbob (Sims logo)
	- After positioning the images, I used color manipulation to create a sense of depth in the objects
	- The images appear to be 3D, but are actually just a series of triangles 

	* This program requires OpenGL + GLFW + GLEW *

To run:
	* This program requires OpenGL + GLFW + GLEW *
	- After installing OpenGL + GLFW + GLEW, simply add the .cpp file to the same directory and compile
	- The program should display both images on a black background 
	
*To see how I went through the process of creating the images, please see the PDF in the project repository*
